# c3-ble-proxy
Configuration for running Home Assistant BLE proxy on an ESP32-C3 Super mini

Getting the BLE proxy up an running was not straight-forward. The official installer does (currently) not support the C3 variant of ESP32, and I had to search through several posting in the community forum of Home Assistant as well as registered tickets for ESPHome in order to find something, that made it possible to get the BLE Proxy up and running on the C3 Super Mini board.

The board being used for this configuration is this one: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005967641936.html
